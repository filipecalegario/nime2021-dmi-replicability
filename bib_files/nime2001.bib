We present custom controllers and unique adaptations of standard gestural interfaces, a programmable connectivity processor, a communications protocol called Open Sound Control(OSC), and a variety of metaphors for musical control. We further describe applications of our technology to a variety of real musical performances and directions for future research.}

Our implementation uses an electric violin, whose spatial position modifies filter parameters of the resonance model. Simplicial interpolation defines the mapping from spatial position to filter parameters. With some effort, pitch tracking can also control the filter parameters. The individual technologies -- motion tracking, pitch tracking, resonance models -- are easily adapted to other instruments.}

A combination of sensory outputs providing both discrete and continuous data gives the subtle expressiveness and control necessary for interactive music.}

It gives users a 3dimensional tangible interface to control music using their hands, and can be used in conjunction with a traditional musical instrument and a microphone, or as a stand-alone gestural input device. The surface of the MATRIX acts as areal-time interface that can manipulate the parameters of a synthesis engine or effect algorithm in response to a performer's expressive gestures. One example is to have the rods of the MATRIX control the individual grains of a granular synthesizer, thereby "sonically sculpting" the microstructure of a sound. In this way, the MATRIX provides an intuitive method of manipulating sound with avery high level of real-time control.}
