                <p class="text-muted">This paper presents the results of an observational study focusing on the collaborative learning processes of a group of performers with an interactive musical system. The main goal of this study was to implement methods for learning and developing practice with these technological objects in order to generate future pedagogical methods. During the research period of six months, four participants regularly engaged in workshop-type scenarios where learning objectives were proposed and guided by themselves.The principal researcher, working as participant-observer, did not impose or prescribed learning objectives to the other members of the group. Rather, all participants had equal say in what was to be done and how it was to be accomplished. Results show that the group learning environment is rich in opportunities for learning, mutual teaching, and for establishing a comunal practice for a given interactive musical system.Key findings suggest that learning by demonstration, observation and modelling are significant for learning in this context. Additionally, it was observed that a dialogue and a continuous flow of information between the members of the community is needed in order to motivate and further their learning.</p>
